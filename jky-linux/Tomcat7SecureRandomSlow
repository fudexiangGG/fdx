The secure random calls may be blocking as there is not enough entropy to feed them in /dev/random.

If you have the line

securerandom.source=file:/dev/random

in /jre/lib/security/java.security, changing this to urandom may improve things (although this is probably already the default).

Alternatively there are some suggestions on how to feed the pool here
